# ArchitectureDiagrams

This repository is a braindump of thoughts and ideas about software architecture, captured through diagrams and code samples. The goal is to document and visualize architectural patterns, concepts, and solutions for reference and inspiration.

## Structure

- **Simple_Batch_Small_AWS_DataPlatform/**
  - Contains code and diagrams related to a simple, batch-oriented data platform architecture on AWS.
  - Example: `generatediagram.py` generates architecture diagrams programmatically.
  - Additional subfolders and files may represent specific architectural patterns or experiments.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

'git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ArchitectureDiagrams.git'

2. Explore the folders for diagrams and code samples.
3. Run Python scripts (such as `generatediagram.py`) to generate or view architecture diagrams.

## Purpose

- Capture and share architectural ideas in a visual and executable format.
- Serve as a reference for designing and discussing software architectures.
- Encourage experimentation with different architectural approaches.

Finally, I know this is bad practice but I sometimes push directly to main because I enjoy spending 45 mins trying to reconcile conflicts
